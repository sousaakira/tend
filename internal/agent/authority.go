// An agent can say what it is doing instead of being watched doing it. A hook
// installed into the agent reports "working", "blocked", "idle" over the
// session's socket, and that report is better evidence than the screen: it is
// the agent's own account, not a reading of what it happened to draw.
//
// Better, not unconditional. A report outlives the thing it describes — the
// agent exits, another program takes the pane, and the last report still says
// "working". So the two sources are arbitrated, and the rules are herdr's
// (`terminal/state.rs`):
//
//   - A report for a different agent than the one detected in the pane is
//     ignored: the screen says who is there, and the hook does not get to argue.
//   - Reports from one source are ordered by a sequence number, and one that is
//     not newer than the last is dropped. Hooks are separate processes racing
//     each other to a socket; arrival order is not sending order.
//   - When the detected agent changes away from the one a report was about, the
//     report is dropped with it.
//   - A blocker visible on the screen beats a hook that says otherwise, as long
//     as the screen was read after the hook spoke: an agent asking for
//     permission is blocked whatever its last report was.
//   - A few integrations cover the agent's whole lifecycle, and for those the
//     screen is not consulted at all while the agent is the one detected. The
//     rest are hints between screen readings.
//
// Not ported yet, and recorded in docs/PORTING.md: herdr's bookkeeping for
// suppressed and stale full-lifecycle sessions, its window after an observed
// process exit, agent names, and metadata reports.
