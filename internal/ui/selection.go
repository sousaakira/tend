// Selecting text is the one thing a terminal multiplexer takes away.
//
// Asking the terminal for mouse reporting is what makes panes clickable, and
// it is also what stops the terminal doing its own selection: the drag now
// belongs to the program, not to the window. Most terminals keep a way out
// under Shift, but it selects across the whole window — the other panes, the
// borders, the sidebar — which for a column of text in a split is not a way
// out at all.
//
// So the selection is drawn here, over the pane it started in, and copied to
// the clipboard through the terminal rather than through any one platform's
// tools.

// Selection is a range of cells in one pane, from where the drag started to
// where the pointer is now.
//
// It keeps both ends rather than a normalised pair, because which one moves
// depends on which way the drag went, and normalising early loses that.

	// set. A selection follows the text, not the screen: when the view moves
	// under it the ends move with it, so what it covers does not change.

	// own panels, and a run spanning three lines takes the whole width of the
	// middle one, panel and all. A rectangle takes the columns the drag
