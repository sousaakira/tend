// Package agents is the catalog of agent CLIs tend knows how to find and
// install: for each, the executables that mean it is there, how to ask it
// its version, and the ways its vendor documents to install it.
//
// It is tend's own — herdr installs hooks into agents (internal/integration,
// which this reuses for the executables), not the agents themselves. Finding
// runs where the agents run, the server's machine; installing is a command
// the client runs in a tab of its own, so the user sees it, answers it and can
// stop it. Nothing here installs anything by itself.
