// Package server owns a running tend session.
//
// It pairs the pure records in internal/session with the live halves they
// describe: a pty, a terminal, and a detector per pane. The split is the point
// — a pane's identity and place in the layout outlive its process, and the
// session can be reasoned about without any of this running.
//
// # Locking
//
// Two levels, always taken in this order and never the reverse:
//
//  1. the server's lock, guarding the session tree and the runtime map
//  2. a pane runtime's own lock, guarding that pane's terminal
//
// Pane output never touches the server's lock, which is what keeps one busy
// agent from serialising every other pane through a single mutex. Callbacks
// from inside a terminal record into the runtime and let the detection loop
// carry the result up.
