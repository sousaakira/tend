// A handoff replaces the server without ending what runs in its panes.
//
// Restarting loses every program: a restored pane is a new shell under the old
// scrollback, and an agent half way through a task is gone. A handoff keeps
// them. The terminals are open descriptors, and a descriptor can be given to
// another process — so the old server stops reading, writes down what each
// terminal looked like, gives the terminals to its replacement, and leaves
// without hanging anything up. The programs never learn that the process on the
// other end of their terminal changed.
//
// The order is what makes it safe, and it is herdr's: stop the readers first,
// so not a byte is consumed by a server that is about to forget it; hand over;
// wait to be told the replacement has everything; only then let go. Until that
// word arrives the old server can take it all back and carry on as though
// nothing had been tried.
