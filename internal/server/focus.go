// 1004): an editor dims its cursor, an agent stops animating, a shell reloads
// what changed while you were away. tend recorded the request and never sent
// anything, so every such program believed it had the focus for ever.
//
// Focus in tend is which pane the user is looking at, which is the client's
// business; the terminal that has to be told is the server's. So the client
// says which pane it focused, and the server tells the programs — the one that
// gained it and the one that lost it — but only those that asked.
