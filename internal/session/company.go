// groupings of workspaces, for whoever looks at the session to organise it
// by — the companies one works for, each with its clients' spaces. They are
// presentation only. A workspace in a company runs exactly as one outside
// it, and membership is many-to-many as herdr's is: the same space may be
// kept under two companies.
//
// herdr calls them spaces; tend already calls its workspaces that, so here
// they are companies, which is what they were asked for as.
