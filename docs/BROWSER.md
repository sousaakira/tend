# tend and a browser

tend does not render pages. A real browser does, and talks to the tend
server, which stands between it and the agents: what the browser picks goes
into the session's context buffer, and from there to whichever agent the
user sends it to. No browser talks to an agent directly.

```

                     ◄── commands ──┘
```

## The browser tend opens

The toolbar's Browser (prefix+B) — or `tend browser launch [url]` — opens a
page in tend's browser when no browser is attached to the session yet: a
Chromium-family browser in a profile of the session's own
(`~/.local/share/tend/browser/<session>/`), started with tend's extension
loaded. Nothing is installed by hand, and the user's own browser and
profile are not touched.

- **The extension** (`internal/browserext/extension/`, built into tend and
  written out each time the browser opens, so it is always the running
  tend's) connects to the native messaging host `dev.tend.browser` as it
  starts, and follows the session's commands. Its manifest carries a fixed
  key, so its ID is always `kafdikfjfbpngnlobakdlnepmciniffa`.
- **Picking and notes**: its toolbar icon or Alt+Shift+T turns picking on in
  the page. The element under the pointer is outlined with its selector over
  it; a click takes it and opens a note on it (Enter saves, Shift+Enter a new
  line, Esc skips), and picking goes on, so several are taken in a row, each
  numbered on the page. Esc, or Done picking, stops. A floating chat button
  holds them all: each with its note, editable there, sent to tend on its
  own or removed. Over them is a message box, for what is wanted of all of
  them together; Copy all copies the message and them, in the text tend
  hands an agent, and Send all to tend puts the message (as a `text` item)
  and them into the session's context. A note still being written when
  either is pressed goes with it. The extension never types into an agent
  itself: the client opens the context panel as they arrive (or says so, if
  another panel is up), and the user sends them from there — `s` one,
  `S` or Send all everything, oldest first, to the pane they were in —
  having seen what goes. What is taken
  is kept per tab and page, so a reload finds it again; it goes when the
  browser closes. It is all drawn in a shadow root, apart from the page's
  styles.
- **The bridge** (`tend browser bridge`) is that host: the browser starts it,
  from a script in the profile, with the environment the browser was started
  with (`TEND_BROWSER_SESSION`, and `TEND_BROWSER_REMOTE` for a session over
  ssh). It speaks native messaging — JSON after four bytes of its length —
  on its standard streams, attaches to the session as a browser, passes each
  command on, and takes the extension's requests to the socket: only the
  browser's own (`browser.context`, `browser.send_to_agent`,
  `browser.status`). Its registration is in the profile's
  `NativeMessagingHosts/`, where a browser started on that profile looks.
- **Which browser**: `[browser] program` if set, else the first of chromium,
  chromium-browser, microsoft-edge, vivaldi, google-chrome-for-testing. Tried
  on 2026-09-23: Chromium 153 and Edge 153 load the extension; Google Chrome
  154 and Brave 153 do not, since Google's own Chrome stopped honouring
  `--load-extension`, so they are not tried. With none of them, the page
  opens in the desktop's browser without the extension, and tend says so.
  `[browser] command` opens a browser of your own instead, also without it.

A second page for the same session opens as a tab in the browser already
running on that profile.

## The protocol

Everything is on the session's automation socket (`tend api schema` lists
it), one JSON object a line, as every other method there.

### A browser attaches

```json
{"id":"1","method":"browser.attach","params":{"name":"chrome"}}
```

The reply is `{"type":"browser_attached"}`, and from then on the connection
carries the commands the browser is to follow, one a line, until it hangs up:

```json
{"type":"browser_command","action":"open","url":"https://example.com/login"}
{"type":"browser_command","action":"navigate","url":"https://example.com/login"}
{"type":"browser_command","action":"select","on":true}
```

- `open`: the page in a new tab.
- `navigate`: the tab in front goes to the page.
- `select`: element picking on or off — the page highlights what is under
  the pointer, and a click captures it.

Only `http://` and `https://` pages are ever sent.

### Telling it what to do

Any tool, or a person with `tend browser`, sends these; each answers
`{"type":"browser_sent","browsers":N}`, or the error `no_browser` when none
is attached:

| method | params |
|---|---|
| `browser.open` | `url` |
| `browser.navigate` | `url` |
| `browser.select` | `on` (bool) |
| `browser.status` | — (answers the names of the browsers attached) |

The client's own "open a page" (the toolbar's Browser, prefix+B) sends
`browser.open` first, and opens the page on the user's own machine — in
`[browser] command`, or the desktop's browser — when no browser is attached.

### What it captures

The browser hands back what was picked:

```json
{"id":"2","method":"browser.context","params":{
  "url":"https://example.com/login","title":"Login",
  "selector":"#email","tag":"input","text":"",
  "attributes":{"id":"email","name":"email","type":"email"}}}
```

It goes into the context buffer as an `element` from `browser` (a `kind` of
`url` or `text` can be given instead), where the context panel (prefix+C)
lists it and sends it to an agent. Each item can carry a `note` — what the
user wants done with it — which leads it in what the agent is handed.
Several can go at once under `items`, with a `message` that goes in first
as a `text` item; they are checked together and kept all or none. Each
arrival is announced to the clients (the `context-arrived` event), which
open the context panel.
`browser.send_to_agent` takes the same params, or several under `items`, a
`message` to lead them, and a `pane_id`, and goes straight on: the items are kept, and typed together
into that pane — or, with no `pane_id`, the one the user was last in —
without being submitted.

Nothing typed this way can act. Control characters are dropped, so an
escape in a page's text cannot end a bracketed paste early; and a program
that has not asked for bracketed paste — a shell, not an agent — gets the
text on one line, each break shown as ⏎, since a break would be Enter.

## Trying it without a browser

```bash
tend browser attach -name stand-in      # in one terminal: prints commands
tend browser status                     # stand-in
tend browser open https://example.com   # the stand-in prints it
tend api browser.context '{"url":"https://example.com","selector":"h1","text":"Example Domain"}'
```

## Not done

- Firefox: it gives extensions native messaging too, but loads an unsigned
  one only for a session and only through its developer tools, so tend's
  browser is Chromium-family.
- Picking a stretch of text rather than an element, and screenshots, which
  the context's kinds leave room for.
- Knowing when the agent has read what was sent: the extension marks an item
  sent when tend has typed it, not when anybody has pressed Enter.
